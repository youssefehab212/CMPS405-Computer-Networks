# CMPS405-Computer-Networks

This project included developing, simulating, and testing data link layer protocols between two nodes that are
connected with a noisy channel, where the transmission is not error-free, packets may get corrupted,
duplicated, delayed, or lost, and the buffers are of limited sizes.

In this project, the pair of nodes would communicate and exchange messages using the Go Back N
algorithm with noisy channel and sender window of size WS, receiver window of size WR=1, using Byte
Stuffing as a framing algorithm, and Parity Byte as an error detection algorithm
